## SUMMARY:
 This is a throw dart program that stimulates throwing darts.  It then uses throwing darts to approximate the value of pi.

## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: < 1 >

Grace days remaining: < # 4/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 I do not know why it doesn't give me an accurate approximation of pi, even if I enter 10000 darts.  

## REFERENCES:
 TA's and Moore

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 I really struggled with this lab, maybe because I've never approximated pi by taking the number of darts that fall within the circle divided by the total number of darts thrown to get  a ratio of 1/4 pi
